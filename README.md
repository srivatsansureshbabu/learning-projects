# Learning Projects

## Overview
This repository contains small machine learning and programming projects implemented from scratch. Each project is designed to help me (and anyone following along) understand the fundamental concepts behind algorithms and model training, without relying on high-level libraries.

The focus is on learning by doing, experimenting with core principles, and documenting the process clearly.

## Projects Included
- **Perceptron From Scratch** – single-layer perceptron trained to learn the AND gate.
- **Linear Regression From Scratch** – gradient descent implementation to fit a line to data.
- **Logistic Regression From Scratch** – gradient descent implementation that predicts the likelihood of passing based on hours studied, hours slept, and practice problems completed.

Each project is organized in its own folder with:
- Implementation code
- README with explanation
- Notes on training and results

## How to Use
1. Browse the folders to find a project of interest
2. Follow the README in each project to understand the code and run it yourself
3. Use these projects as learning examples or expand on them for practice
